        ------
        - The function first determines the intersection geometry using the `_get_intersecting_geometry` method.
        - It handles both single points and multipoints:
            - For single points, it calculates the normalized position and distance, then returns a list with
              a single dictionary.
            - For multipoints, it iterates through each point, calculating and returning a list of dictionaries
              representing each intersection.
        - If the intersection geometry is invalid (i.e., not a point or multipoint), the function raises an
          exception to indicate the error.
        - The function can optionally transform the intersection geometry to SRID 4326 if `neoj4_point` is set.
